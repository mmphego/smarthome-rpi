# Raspberry Pi Smart Home Automation Project

This repository contains everything to do with my BTech project that I submitted in 2016 at the Tshwane University of Technology while based in Cape Town.

I have also added my thesis which will give you a more detailed overview of what this repository is all about.

Thesis titled: [Designing A Smart Home Automation With Voice Recognition Using Raspberry Pi And Arduino](Thesis.pdf)


## Usage [archive/deprecated]
Not sure the usage anymore but ideally one would copy all files into `/home/pi`. Update `Backup_configs/wpa_supplicant.conf` with your WiFi connections and move all files to `/etc`

```
sudo apt-get install $(grep -vE "^\s*#" Apts/apt-build-requirements.txt | tr "\n" " ")
sudo pip insrall -r Apts/pip-build-requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, checkout `Scripts` directory and mangle around.
Note: This code is over 4 yrs old as of 12/2019

## Demo

About a year ago I blogged about the project due to the amount of hits I received I then decided why not upload this on my GitHub (Who knows maybe someone might find this stuff useful), I've listed the content of the blog post below.

### [Project] Smart Home Automation using Raspberry Pi and Arduino

About 2 years ago, as part of my requirement to obtain my degree I came up, designed and development a project titled: [Smart Home Automation using Raspberry Pi and Arduino](https://goo.gl/yuYdRq) and fortunately enough I made a demo about it.

## 3. Android Gesture Control

[Update: 26/11/19] This was one the coolest feature I came up with, and referenced these papers.

---------------------------------------

*I will try to detail the design and etc on another post - soon.*

All code is available, just drop me a mail. I have been procrastinating on hosting the code to [GitHub](https://github.com/mmphego/smarthome-rpi).
