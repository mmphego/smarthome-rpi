-Passive wifi presence detection on Raspberry Pi

http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijdsn/2013/927940/


My bash skills are pretty rudimentary so no doubt there's a more efficient way to do this, and there may be some syntax errors since I copied it out by hand.
The way this works is as follows:
1) NOT SHOWN: The script runs every ten seconds or so.
2) If it's between 7am and 10pm then
3) Ping my phone's IP address (needs to be static obviously) once with a timeout of 5 seconds and store the result in a file 'devicelist'.
4) Test for a positive ping result and store it in the variable 'status'.
5) Compare the current status with the last time it was run.
6) If the status has changed from the last time we looked then
7) Check if the status was positive (i.e. phone was found)
8) and do something appropriate. I have mine set to announce my presence with text-to-speech.
9) Finally, save the current result to a file 'ishome' so we can compare it next time.
The time restriction is simply a convenience. Due to occasional network dropouts I found I was being woken up by the apparent presence or absence of my phone being announced. On the whole it works pretty well, but I'd advise against mission-critical use for that reason.
#!/bin/bash
# Checks for presence of device and speaks a notification

NOW=$(date +"%s")
dayBegin=$(date --date="Today 07:00" +"%s")
dayEnd=$(date --date="Today 22:00" +"%s")

if [ ${NOW} -gt ${dayBegin} ] && [ ${NOW} -lt ${dayEnd} ]; then
    ping 192.168.1.40 -c 1 -W 5 > /home/pi/devicelist
    status=$(grep -i -c '1 received' /home/pi/devicelist)
    prevStatus=$(cat /home/pi/ishome)

    if [ $status = $prevStatus ]; then
        echo "No change"
    else
        if [ $status = "1" ]; then
            echo "Phone detected"
        else
            echo "Phone lost"
        fi
    fi

    echo $status > /home/pi/ishome
fi
